# **App Name**: Literary Love

## Core Features:

- Hero Portrait: Display a high-quality, rounded portrait of the birthday celebrant at the top of the page, with subtle animation on page load to draw the eye.
- Animated Letter Modal: A button that, when pressed, opens a modal with a personal letter. The modal features a gradient border and a smooth, animated entrance.
- Shakespearean Quote Generator: AI tool generates personalized romantic quotes in a Shakespearean style, related to love and birthdays, to be displayed throughout the website.

## Style Guidelines:

- Dark theme with deep blues and blacks for the background to create a sophisticated, modern feel.
- Use gold or rose gold as an accent color for highlights, button borders, and text to add a touch of elegance and romance.
- Use a soft, muted purple (#A090B9) as an accent color for secondary elements.
- Ensure the website is fully responsive, with a focus on mobile-first design. Content should be well-spaced and easy to read on smaller screens.
- Subtle animations and transitions throughout the site. For example, a gentle fade-in effect for text and images, and a smooth transition for the modal.
- Incorporate book-related icons (e.g., open book, quill, inkwell) in a minimalist style. These should be used sparingly to enhance the novel theme.
